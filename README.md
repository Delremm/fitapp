Does anyone know how strstd calculates 1RM? Like formula wise? Or at least methodology?

Weight + Weight * Reps * (1/30)
So if I can do 5 reps of 100kg that's 100 + 100 * 5 * (1/30) = 117 kg

Last time I checked by trial and error, it seems to use Lombardi for squat and deadlift, and Mayhew et al. for bench and OHP.
